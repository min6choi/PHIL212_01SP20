          Through what we learn, we make a view of a society. The PHIL212_01SP20 class showed me a new paradigm about the society.
           So i worked on a date visualization project based on the syllabus of The PHIL212_01SP20 class. To visualize an invisible thing that had a 
           major impact on me was a main purpose of this project. When you look at all these charts, our society is made up of the perspectives of 
           various members, but it is very rare to learn that diversity. So, in the absence of such an experience, most of us will find that we 
           can only think in old point of view when we see the society.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          For this project, I used data of two social philosophy classes which I took in 2020 (Philosophical Reflections 
          on Political Power of MUS and Philosophical Critique of the Modern Civil Society of UOS).
           And for more reliable analysis, I used another data of social philosophy classes which I didn't take but had a class
            in 2017 (The body politic of MUS and Philosophy of civic society of UOS )
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The main categories which are at the top are gender and nationality that i visualized using bar charts. These two were the most striking differences
           I recognized. The categories below are a visualization of the data from the two classes I took in 2020. I did 
           image-mapping and categorization. When you click on each philosopher face, their name, gender and country, will reveal as well as a link of Wikipedia page.
