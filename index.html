          Through what we learn, we make a view of a society. The PHIL212_01SP20 class showed me a new paradigm about the society.
           So i worked on a date visualization project based on the syllabus of The PHIL212_01SP20 class. To visualize an invisible thing that had a 
           major impact on me was a main purpose of this project. When i finished the project, i could see that what i realized that much of 
           what we learn depends on where and from whom and we cannot recognize it until we experience it by ourselves.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          For this project, I used data of two social philosophy classes which I took in 2020 (Philosophical Reflections 
          on Political Power of MUS and Philosophical Critique of the Modern Civil Society of UOS).
           And for more reliable analysis, I used another data of social philosophy classes which I didn't take but had a class
            in 2017 (The body politic of MUS and Philosophy of civic society of UOS )
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The main categories which are at the top are gender and nationality that i visualized using bar charts. These two were the most striking differences
           I recognized. The categories below are a visualization of the data from the two classes I took in 2020. I did 
           image-mapping and categorization. Clicking on each philosopher will reveal their name, gender and country, as well as links to Wikipedia pages.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Lastly, I would like to thank the professor who helped me the most with this project. The professor not only gave me a meaningful 
          class but also provided a syllabus of a class that I did not take.
