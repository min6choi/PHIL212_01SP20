          Through what we learn, we make a view of a society. <a style=color:#031BFF>This class</a> was a new paradigm of the society for me.
           So based on this, i worked on a date visualization project to visualize the invisible that had a 
           major impact on my change. As i work on this project, i realized that much of what we learn depends
            on where and from whom, and we cannot recognize it until we experience it by ourselves.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          In this project I used data of two social philosophy classes which I took in 2020 (Philosophical Reflections 
          on Political Power of MUS in 2020-spring and Philosophical Critique of the Modern Civil Society of UOS in 2020-fall).
           And for more precisely analysis, I used another data of social philosophy classes which I didn't take but had a class
            in 2017 (The body politic of MUS in 2017 and Philosophy of civic society of UOS in 2017)
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Looking at the top category, I tried to reveal the difference I felt more clearly by dividing 
          the difference I felt the most into two categories, gender and country. And through the categories
           below, philosophers and sociologists in the curriculum of the social philosophy class that I took
            in msu and uos for one year in 2020 were image-mapped and categorized around the large category
             of country. Clicking on each philosopher will reveal gender and country, as well as links to 
             Wikipedia pages.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          lastly, I would like to thank the professor who helped me the most with this project. The professor
           not only gave me meaningful classes, but also provided a curriculum for 2017 classes that I did 
           not take for my project.
