          Through what we learn, we make a view of society. This social philosophy class not only 
          changed my stereotypes, it made me feel completely different from other philosophy classes 
          before. So I worked on this personal date visualization project to visualize the invisible 
          that had a major impact on my change. As i work on this project, i realized that much of 
          what we learn depends on <a style=color:#031BFF>where and from whom,</a> and we cannot recognize it until we first experience it.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          To proceed with the project, I used the social philosophy curriculum data for the 2020-1 
          semester (Philosophical Reflections on Political Power) and 2020-2 semester,(Philosophical 
          Critique of the Modern Civil Society) which I took classes for one year in 2020. Used together.
           For wider data, the curriculum data from the 2017 social philosophy classes at the same school
            was also used. (The body politic) (philosophy of civic society)
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Looking at the top category, I tried to reveal the difference I felt more clearly by dividing 
          the difference I felt the most into two categories, gender and country. And through the categories
           below, philosophers and sociologists in the curriculum of the social philosophy class that I took
            in msu and uos for one year in 2020 were image-mapped and categorized around the large category
             of country. Clicking on each philosopher will reveal gender and country, as well as links to 
             Wikipedia pages.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          lastly, I would like to thank the professor who helped me the most with this project. The professor
           not only gave me meaningful classes, but also provided a curriculum for 2017 classes that I did 
           not take for my project.
